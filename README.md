Using the Blockchain Technology we have made it possible to dramatically increase the accountability and transparency of public financing to reduce corruption. For example, if the government decides to construct a road, we can now track how each Rupee being spent, identify all the users of the funds, and ensure that only those authorized to spend money do so on originally intended expenses within the permitted time. Fraud and corruption investigations that now take on average 15 months could be performed at the touch of a button and at a fraction of the cost. More importantly, this type of financial tracking would be a deterrent for bribes in the public sector, which amount to between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion annually, roughly 2 percent of National GDP. This in turn would increase development impact.Hence ultimately making the state development in a very accurate way. All this just by adopting our blockchain software into the present system
